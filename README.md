# DA13_Energy_Capstone
I would like to present a look into access to electricity and sustainable energy by the country. Assessing current access and diving into the data to see potential for growth to aid in access. This will include topics such as;
-	Access to electricity
-	Energy Consumption
-	World Energy Scores
-	Population Data
-	Photovoltaic/Solar Energy Potential
# Motivation
What does data do best? It can have tangible impacts by giving the data a voice to tell a story. I chose this project due to the rise in discussions on sustainable energy and access to electricity over the years. I was curious to see what that would look like. I think it is important to include factors such as population, access, cost, and consumption when discussing these ideas and theories on potential growth of sustainable energy for a multitude of countries.
# Data Question
What does energy look like in each country? This could be displayed in a numerous number of ways; however, I will be using a few key points to display multiple visualizations. These key points will include but may not be limited to; electricity access, energy consumption, energy scores, population data, photovoltaic/solar energy potential, and more.
# Data Sources
